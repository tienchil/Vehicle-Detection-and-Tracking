# Vehicle Detection and Tracking

This project is the fifth one in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Term 1.
The main goal of this project is to train a classifier and use it to detect vehicles in a short video.

The result of this project is in video form, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=xh9sE1YCyyY).
